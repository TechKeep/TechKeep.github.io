<p>Welcome to TechKeep.net!</p>

<p>As you probably already noticed, this website is very new. You might still encounter a few irregular occurences every now and then as I get everything sorted. That being said, I'm happy to finally have been able to publish this. It's been a long time coming, and frankly, I'm glad I pushed for it.</p>

<h6>Who am I?</h6>
<p>I'm a general developer. By that, I mean that I'm a programmer and I do a little bit of everything. I never went public before, so I figured it was time I finally did!</p>

<h6>What is this website for?</h6>
<p>On this website, which is more of a personal blog, I will post about anything related to (but not limited to) subjects such as tech and gaming. I will put up some news, tutorials, tips, tricks, etc. I might also end up publishing some of my own software here, but this has yet to be decided.</p>

<h6>Why did I decide to create this website?</h6>
<p>I found myself having to piece together a lot of information from too many sources over too long periods of time when attempting to do some specific tasks or projects. I figured having a place where I could gather all the relevant information in one spot would not only be beneficial to me when re-doing said tasks or projects in the future, but also to others trying to do the same thing and looking for the same information.</p>

<h6>Why is there no comment section?</h6>
<p>It is not planned to have a comment section on this website. I do not want any personal data to be collected. Check out the <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> page for more details, especially regarding ads. That said, I'm still thinking about ways to effectively receive comments. Linking to a Twitter thread? Linking to a Reddit thread? Both? I don't know yet.</p>

<p>Alright, this pretty much sums it up. I hope you'll enjoy what this website will have to offer!</p>

<p>- TechKeep</p>
